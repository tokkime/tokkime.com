# tokkime.com - portfolio thing

## tl;dr

it's a tiny website. looks kinda like ethan chng's site, if ethan chng's site fell down a flight of stairs and then tried to fix itself with duct tape.

shows off some thumbnails and videos, loads 'em from text files. has some fadey-slidey animations that mostly work.

## tech

html, css, javascript. the usual suspects. don't look too close at the code, you might scare it.

## how to run

1.  put your image urls in `thumbnails/thumbnails.txt` and youtube links in `videos/videos.txt`.
2.  ?
3.  profit

that's it. go nuts. or don't. whatever
